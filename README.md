# Shortest Path Finder in 2D Grid

This project contains a Python implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path through a 2D grid. The grid consists of cells that can either be passable (0) or blocked (1). The goal is to calculate the shortest distance from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, moving only up, down, left, or right, and not through blocked cells.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design.
- BFS algorithm for shortest path finding.
- Grid validation to ensure movements are within the bounds and on passable paths.

## Installation

No specific installation is required, as this project uses Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use this program, you can clone the repository and run the `main.py` script. Here's how you can get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramonfounder/shortest-path-in-a-2d-grid.git
   cd shortest-path-in-a-2d-grid
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The `main.py` script contains a predefined grid and prints out the shortest path length. You can modify the grid in the `main.py` file to test different scenarios.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the implementation or suggestions for additional features are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
